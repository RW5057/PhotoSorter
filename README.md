# PhotoSorter
This is a simple photo sorter.  It's intended use is to go through a collection of images and allow the user to do simple processing, like rotation and cropping, and to save the best images.  The image files can optionally be sent to a processed folder after viewing so the user can pick up from where they left off easily.
